❯ keep as-is.... we'll merge everything back to main and just stick with the same branch for now.  we know what we're doing here       
  (indicator / feature development planning/design/etc.).                                                                              
                                                                                                                                       
  I see you have "fractal_dimension", is that the fractal technical analysis set of indicators?  If not, web research fractal          
  technical indicators and how to implement it as a feature.  Besides that and things like wavelets and hurst_exponent, what other     
  fractal analysis / fractal market analysis techniques can we apply as features?  Things like Levy Index, Power-Law Distributions,    
  Katz’s Fractal Dimension (KFD), Higuchi’s Fractal Dimension (HFD), etc.?  Research the web.                                          
                                                                                                                                       
  What about Ergodic Theory & Ergodic Economics methods/tools?  Could any of that contribute to signal?                                
                                                                                                                                       
  I know we are already doing Fourier Transform analysis.  What other spectral analytic methods may apply to market analysis and       
  provide signal, which we haven't already covered?  (Research the web.)                                                               
                                                                                                                                       
  Look into Cubic, Quintic, and Higher-Order Polynomial Indicators; Girsanov Theorem & Risk-Neutral Pricing; Backward Stochastic       
  Differential Equations; and Coherence & de Finetti’s Principle.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                       
  Review https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-m-looking-for-a-comprehensiv-gCqKAVUtQ72EwsIhe_EDFQ#0 and look into other ideas like       
  deterministic topographical anlalytic methods, fractional brownian motion (and other fractional calculus), etc.

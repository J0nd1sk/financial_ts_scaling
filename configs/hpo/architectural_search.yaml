# Architectural HPO search space for scaling experiments
#
# This config is used for Phase 6A architectural HPO where we search both
# model architecture (from arch_grid.py) AND training parameters.
#
# Key difference from default_search.yaml:
# - Architecture params (d_model, n_layers, n_heads, d_ff) come from pre-computed
#   valid architecture grid, not from this config
# - Training params use NARROWER ranges since we have fewer trials per architecture
# - Key is "training_search_space" (not "search_space") to distinguish purpose

# Study configuration
n_trials: 50
timeout_hours: null  # No timeout - rely on n_trials
direction: minimize  # Minimize validation loss

# Training parameter search space (narrower ranges for architectural HPO)
# Architecture params are sampled separately from arch_grid.py

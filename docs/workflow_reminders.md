## Draft Notes Policy

**File**: `docs/research_paper/draft_notes.md`

This is a scratchpad for raw analysis chunks — not authoritative.

**Rules**:
- Do NOT read during session restore
- Do NOT read before adding new analysis chunks
- Append each chunk independently based on fresh analysis
- Content may be wrong or incomplete
- Only review during paper-writing phase when synthesizing

**Rationale**: Drafts are working notes that could contain errors. Reading them risks anchoring to potentially incorrect analysis. Each analysis should be fresh.

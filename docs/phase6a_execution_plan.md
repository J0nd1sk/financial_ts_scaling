# Phase 6A Execution Plan

**Status: Stage 3 re-running** | Updated: 2025-12-30 | v2.1

**Objective:** Parameter scaling baseline - test if error ∝ N^(-α)

**Secondary Research Question:** Do optimal hyperparameters vary significantly with prediction horizon? This will determine whether we need separate HPO per horizon in future phases.

## Experiment Matrix

**Hold Constant:**
- Features: 25 (5 OHLCV + 20 indicators) - **NO VIX** (VIX is Phase 6D only)
- Data: SPY only (`data/processed/v1/SPY_dataset_a25.parquet`)
- Timescale: daily

**Vary:**
- Parameter budget: 2M, 20M, 200M, 2B
- Prediction horizon: 1-day, 3-day, 5-day (to test if HPO params vary)

## Data Configuration

| Dataset | Path | Features | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| Phase 6A-6C | `SPY_dataset_a25.parquet` | 25 | 5 OHLCV + 20 indicators |
| Phase 6D | `SPY_dataset_c.parquet` | 33 | Adds 8 VIX features |

## Execution Strategy

### Stage 1: Validate Pipeline (First HPO Test) ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed: 2025-12-11**

Ran 3-trial HPO to validate end-to-end pipeline:

```bash
python experiments/phase6a/hpo_2M_threshold_1pct.py  # 3 trials, ~2.5 min
```

**Validated:**
- [x] Data loading from `SPY_dataset_a25.parquet`
- [x] ChunkSplitter creates proper train/val/test splits
- [x] HPO optimizes val_loss (not train_loss)
- [x] Results logged to `docs/experiment_results.csv`
- [x] Best params saved to `outputs/hpo/`

### Stage 2: Horizon Variance Test (2M Only) ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed: 2025-12-13**

Tested if HPO params vary by horizon using 2M budget:

| Script | Budget | Horizon | Best Val Loss | Best Architecture |
|--------|--------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| `hpo_2M_h1_threshold_1pct.py` | 2M | 1-day | 0.337 | d=64, L=48, h=8 |
| `hpo_2M_h3_threshold_1pct.py` | 2M | 3-day | 0.262 | d=64, L=32, h=32 |
| `hpo_2M_h5_threshold_1pct.py` | 2M | 5-day | — | ⏳ Not run |

**Decision: Option A selected — horizon variance IS significant**

Key findings:
- h3 achieves significantly lower loss than h1 (0.262 vs 0.337)
- Optimal architecture varies by horizon (different depth/heads configurations)
- Conclusion: Separate HPO per horizon required for valid scaling analysis

### Stage 3: Full HPO Matrix 🔄 RE-RUNNING (optimized scripts)

**Status: Fresh re-run in progress** (2025-12-30)

> **Why re-run?** Previous runs (2025-12-11 to 2025-12-21) lacked critical optimizations:
> - Dropout search (was hardcoded at 0.1, now 0.1-0.3 HPO range)
> - Dynamic batch sizing (memory-safe batch selection per architecture)
> - Gradient accumulation (maintains effective batch=256 with small actual batches)
> - Early stopping (patience=10 prevents wasted compute)
>
> All 12 runs archived to `outputs/hpo/archive/20251230_122812/` and re-executing with optimized scripts.

**Option A Selected: 12 HPO runs per budget** (4 budgets × 3 horizons × 1 task)

Rationale:
- Horizon variance confirmed in Stage 2 → separate HPO per horizon
- Focus on threshold_1pct task only (simplest binary classification)
- Skip 2%, 3%, 5% tasks → can borrow/interpolate from 1% results later

| Budget | h1 Status | h3 Status | h5 Status |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 2M | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending |
| 20M | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending |
| 200M | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending |
| 2B | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending |

### Stage 4: Final Training 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Status: Blocked on Stage 3 re-run**

After all HPO completes:
1. Run final training with best params per budget/horizon
2. Compute test set metrics
3. Plot scaling curves: log(error) vs log(params)
4. Fit power law: error = C × N^(-α)

**Current blockers:**
- All 12 HPO runs pending (fresh re-run with optimized scripts)

**Scripts location:** `experiments/phase6a/`
**Runner:** `scripts/run_phase6a_hpo.sh`

## Estimated Runtime

| Budget | Est. HPO (50 trials) | Actual HPO | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| 2M | ~12-15 hours | ~4 hours | Faster than expected |
| 20M | ~25-35 hours | ~4-5 hours | Faster than expected |
| 200M | ~50-100 hours | ~48-82 hours | h5 took longest (narrow-deep arch) |
| 2B | ~200-300 hours | TBD | Memory optimizations applied |

**Actual Stage Durations:**
- Stage 1 (Validation): ~2.5 min (3 trials)
- Stage 2 (Horizon Test): ~6 hours (2M × 2 horizons)
- Stage 3 (Full Matrix): ~200 hours cumulative (2M/20M/200M complete)

**2B Memory Challenges:**
- Original 2B trials consumed 115GB+ memory
- Deep+wide architectures (d=1024, L=256) caused swap thrashing
- Optimization stage (Dec 26-29) added: dynamic batch sizing, gradient accumulation, early stopping
- Post-optimization: 2B smoke test (3 trials) completed successfully in ~4.3 hours

## Key Decisions

### 2025-12-11 (Initial Design)

1. **Feature Count:** Phase 6A uses 25 features (5 OHLCV + 20 indicators). VIX features (8) reserved for Phase 6D.

2. **Data File:** Use `SPY_dataset_a25.parquet` (not `SPY_dataset_c.parquet` which has VIX).

3. **Horizon Testing:** Test 1-day, 3-day, 5-day horizons to determine if HPO params vary significantly.

4. **Staged Execution:** Validate → horizon variance test → full matrix decision.

### 2025-12-13 (HPO Fixes)

5. **n_heads Logging:** Fixed missing n_heads in architecture logging.

6. **Grid Gaps:** Added L=160, L=180 to n_layers grid for better coverage.

7. **Forced Extremes:** First 6 trials force extreme architectures to ensure exploration of design space boundaries.

### 2025-12-21 (200M Complete)

8. **Horizon Variance Confirmed:** h3 consistently achieves lowest loss; h5 prefers narrow-deep architectures.

9. **Optimal Heads:** h=16 consistently outperforms h=8 across budgets.

10. **Architecture Patterns:** Wide-medium (d=768-1024, L=12-24) optimal for h1/h3; narrow-deep (d=256, L=256) optimal for h5.

### 2025-12-26 (2B Memory Issues)

11. **Memory Exhaustion:** 2B trials with d=1024, L=256 consumed 115GB+, caused multi-day swap thrashing.

12. **Optimization Stage:** Launched detour to add dynamic batch sizing, gradient accumulation, early stopping.

### 2025-12-29 (Optimization Complete)

13. **Dynamic Batch Sizing:** `get_memory_safe_batch_config()` selects batch size based on architecture memory footprint.

14. **Gradient Accumulation:** Maintains effective batch size of 256 even with small actual batches.

15. **Early Stopping:** Patience=10 epochs prevents wasted compute on diverging trials.

16. **Dropout Search:** Added dropout (0.1-0.3) to HPO search space (was hardcoded at 0.1).

## Lessons Learned

See `docs/phase6a_implementation_history.md` for detailed history of:
- Architectural HPO implementation (8 tasks)
- HPO fixes (6 tasks)
- Time optimization stage (6 tasks)

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Architectural HPO is essential** — training-only HPO misses the most important scaling variable
2. **Horizon affects optimal architecture** — can't assume same arch works for all prediction lengths
3. **Memory management critical for 2B** — dynamic batch sizing + gradient accumulation required
4. **Early stopping saves significant time** — prevents wasted epochs on diverging trials

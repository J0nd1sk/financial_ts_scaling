# Context Handoff Rules

## Purpose

Sessions end. Context windows fill. Continuity must be maintained.

---

## Handoff Triggers

Initiate handoff when:
- User requests it
- Session ending
- Context window ~80% full
- Switching to different task area
- Before any extended break

---

## Handoff Protocol

### Step 1: Capture State

Write to `.claude/context/session_context.md`:

```markdown
# Session Handoff - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

## Current State

### Branch & Git
- Branch: [current branch name]
- Last commit: [short hash] [message]
- Uncommitted changes: [list files or "none"]
- Staged files: [list or "none"]

### Task Status
- Current task: [what you're working on]
- Status: [in progress / blocked / ready for review]
- Blockers: [if any]

## Test Status
- Last `make test`: [timestamp]
- Result: [pass / fail]
- Failing tests: [list if any]

## Completed This Session
1. [Task completed]
2. [Task completed]

## In Progress
- [Task]: [status and what remains]

## Pending (Not Started)
1. [Next task]
2. [Following task]

## Files Modified This Session
- `path/to/file.py`: [nature of changes]
- `tests/test_file.py`: [what was added/modified]

## Key Decisions Made
- [Decision]: [Rationale]

## Important Context
[Anything that would be lost without explicit capture:
- Discoveries made during debugging
- Rejected approaches and why
- Dependencies between tasks
- User preferences expressed]

## Next Session Should
1. [First priority]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## Commands to Run First
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
make test
git status
```
```

### Step 2: Update Phase Tracker

If phase progress changed, update `.claude/context/phase_tracker.md`:

```markdown
## Phase N: [Phase Name] [STATUS]
- Task A: ✅ Complete [date]
- Task B: 🔄 In Progress (50%)
- Task C: ⏸️ Pending
```

### Step 3: Confirm

Report to user:
- Handoff file location
- Summary of state
- Any uncommitted work warning

---

## Restore Protocol

### At Session Start

1. **Read context files**
   ```
   .claude/context/session_context.md
   .claude/context/phase_tracker.md
   ```

2. **Verify environment**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   make test
   git status
   ```

3. **Summarize to user**
   - Where we left off
   - Current task status
   - Test status
   - Proposed next steps

4. **Confirm priorities**
   - Do not assume previous priorities still hold
   - Ask user to confirm or redirect

5. **Only then proceed**

## Context File Locations

| File | Purpose | Git-tracked |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `.claude/context/session_context.md` | Latest session state | Yes |
| `.claude/context/phase_tracker.md` | Phase progress | Yes |
| `.claude/context/decision_log.md` | Architectural decisions | Yes |

---

## User Commands

Users can trigger protocols with:

- `"handoff"` or `"session handoff"` → Run handoff protocol
- `"restore"` or `"session restore"` → Run restore protocol
- `"status"` → Quick summary without full restore
- `"where were we"` → Restore and summarize
